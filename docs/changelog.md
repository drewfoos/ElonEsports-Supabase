## 2026-04-02 — Idempotency, Optimization & UX Polish

### Idempotency Guards
- `createTournament` — rejects duplicate name + date + semester (prevents manual double-submit)
- `createPlayer` — rejects duplicate gamer tags (case-insensitive)
- `createSemester` — rejects duplicate names (case-insensitive, checked in parallel with overlap validation)
- `confirmTournamentImport` — already had `startgg_event_id` deduplication (no change needed)

### React Optimization
- Fixed drag handler closures in manual tournament creator defeating `React.memo` — callbacks now stable via `useCallback` with index passed as prop
- Memoized merge dialog filter results (`filteredKeepPlayers`, `filteredMergePlayers`) with `useMemo` instead of inline `.filter().slice()` on every keystroke
- Cached merge dialog player data — `allPlayersLoaded` flag prevents refetching on every dialog open; invalidated after successful merge

### Bug Fixes (5-Agent Audit)
- Fixed merge dialog state not resetting on close (mergeKeepId, mergeMergeId, keepSearch, mergeSearch)
- Fixed scoring engine `existingResult` not error-checked in step 8
- Fixed scoring engine lock release error not caught in finally block
- Fixed missing error checks on `updateSemester` parallel fetches (tournamentsRes, allSemestersRes, orphanedRes)
- Fixed missing `keepStatusesRes` error check in `mergePlayers`
- Fixed missing error check on `checkSemesterOverlap` query result
- Fixed dialog state resets for add, edit, and IDs dialogs on close

### Error Pages
- Added `not-found.tsx` (404) with "Back to Leaderboard" link
- Added `error.tsx` (500) with "Try Again" button and console error logging
- Added `global-error.tsx` for errors that escape root layout (includes own `<html>/<body>`)

### Concurrency Safety
- Recalculate button disabled + tooltip when semester has no tournaments (both dashboard dialog and tournaments page)
- Server-side guard: `recalculateSemesterScores` returns early with error message if no tournaments exist
- Per-semester tournament counts passed to dashboard recalculate dialog

### Performance — Leaderboard SSR
- Converted home page from full client-side to Server Component with parallel data fetching
- Semesters, auth state, and initial leaderboard data fetched in one server round trip (zero client waterfalls)
- Interactive UI (semester picker, min tournaments, fireworks) extracted to `leaderboard-client.tsx`
- Eliminated dynamic `import()` of server actions from client bundle
- Replaced Base UI Slider with native `<input type="range">` to fix React script tag error

### UX Polish
- "Admin" button on leaderboard styled as solid primary pill when signed in (subtle "Login" text when signed out)
- "Load Standings" button on start.gg import: flush height with event dropdown, stacks below on mobile
- Recalculate buttons show "No tournaments in this semester" tooltip/message when grayed out

### New Files
- `src/app/not-found.tsx` — 404 page
- `src/app/error.tsx` — Runtime error boundary
- `src/app/global-error.tsx` — Root error boundary
- `src/app/leaderboard-client.tsx` — Interactive leaderboard UI (extracted from page.tsx)

## 2026-04-01 — Leaderboard Redesign, Auto-Semesters & Query Optimization

### Leaderboard Redesign
- Animated podium with Lucide `Trophy` (1st) and `Medal` (2nd/3rd) icons, gradient glows, and drop shadows
- Canvas-based fireworks particle system — 8 staggered bursts with gravity, fade, and glow trails
- Podium cards bounce in with `cubic-bezier` spring animation, medals pop in with rotate/scale
- Staggered row fade-in animation for the rankings table
- Gradient text on "Power Rankings" heading
- Tournament count displayed on each podium card
- Consistent Lucide icons in both podium and table (replacing OS-dependent emoji)

### Auto-Create Semesters
- `findOrCreateSemester(date, client)` — shared helper used by both manual entry and start.gg import
- Academic calendar conventions: Spring (Jan 15 – May 15), Summer (May 16 – Aug 15), Fall (Aug 16 – Dec 20)
- Trims auto-generated range to avoid overlapping existing semesters
- Duplicate name detection with date-range suffix fallback
- Added overlap validation to both `createSemester()` and `updateSemester()`

### Query Optimization
- **Eliminated N+1 queries in `updateSemester`** — fetches all semesters once + parallelizes all tournament move operations instead of querying per-tournament in a loop
- **Removed redundant client creation** — `determineSemester()` (created server client via `cookies()`) replaced with direct queries on existing admin client in `createTournament` and `confirmTournamentImport`
- **Removed dead `determineSemester()` function** — both callers now use `findOrCreateSemester`
- **Reused batch-fetched data in `deletePlayer`** — added `total_participants` to initial tournament query instead of re-fetching each tournament individually
- **Leaderboard fallback** — collapsed two sequential semester queries into one sorted query with client-side pick
- **Minimal column fetches** — semester lookups use `select('id')` instead of `select('*')` in 3 places
- **`.maybeSingle()` over `.single()`** — `getCurrentSemester`, `deleteTournament`, semester lookups (avoids PGRST116 error handling)

### Dead Code Removal
- Removed unused `PlayerSemesterScore` and `GameSet` interfaces from `types.ts`
- Removed unused `Semester` import from `tournaments.ts`

## 2026-04-01 — Performance, Validation & Security Audit

### Performance Optimizations

**Scoring Engine (`src/lib/scoring.ts`) — Complete Rewrite**
- Parallel batch operations: all tournament results fetched in parallel (one query per tournament to avoid Supabase's 1000-row default limit)
- Batched score updates: results with same score value updated in single `WHERE id IN (...)` query (~30 queries instead of ~300)
- Stale score cleanup: deletes leftover scores for players no longer marked Elon
- NaN/Infinity guards on `computeWeight` and `computeScore`
- Changed array type from `Promise[]` to `PromiseLike[]` for Supabase query compatibility

**start.gg Import (`src/lib/actions/tournaments.ts`)**
- Deferred sets import with `after()` from `next/server` — response returns in ~2-3s instead of 15-30s
- Parallel semester lookup + duplicate check in `confirmTournamentImport`
- Parallel players + semester fetch in `buildImportPreview`

**start.gg Client (`src/lib/startgg.ts`)**
- Standings perPage: 64 → 100 (fewer pages, stays under 1000-object complexity cap)
- Sets perPage: 28 → 40
- Inter-page delay: 750ms → 400ms

**Admin Dashboard (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`)**
- Replaced full row fetches with count-only queries (`{ count: 'exact', head: true }`)
- 4 stat cards, recent tournaments list, quick actions
- Uses inline Tailwind classes instead of `buttonVariants()` (server component compatibility)

**Players Page (`src/app/admin/players/page.tsx`)**
- Parallel semester loading with `Promise.all`
- Optimistic Elon status toggle with revert-on-error
- Fixed 1000-row limit bug with paginated tournament_results query

**Tournaments Page (`src/app/admin/tournaments/new/page.tsx`)**
- Lazy player loading: only fetches when Manual Entry tab is activated

**Player Actions (`src/lib/actions/players.ts`)**
- `deletePlayer`: parallel initial data collection, parallel participant decrements, parallel semester recalcs
- `mergePlayers`: 6 queries consolidated to 1 parallel round, self-merge prevention
- `getPlayersWithStatus`: paginated to handle >1000 tournament results

**Semester Actions (`src/lib/actions/semesters.ts`)**
- Parallel recalculations in `updateSemester`

### Data Validation

- All server actions trim and validate inputs (empty gamer tags, empty semester names)
- Tournament creation validates: name required, date format YYYY-MM-DD, ≥1 participant, finite totalParticipants
- Semester date validation: start must be before end (server + client)
- start.gg import filters out standings with invalid placements
- Empty gamer tags from start.gg fall back to "Unknown"
- Scoring engine guards: `computeWeight` and `computeScore` return 0 for NaN/Infinity/negative inputs

### Security

- Case-insensitive email comparison at all 3 auth checkpoints (proxy, layout, `requireAdmin()`)
- Migrated `src/middleware.ts` → `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 convention)
- Confirmed: RLS policies restrict public to read-only, all mutations use service role
- Supabase config: email signups disabled, rate limits configured

### New Files
- `src/app/admin/recalculate-button.tsx` — Client component for manual score recalculation
- `src/proxy.ts` — Replaces `src/middleware.ts` for Next.js 16
- `src/components/ui/popover.tsx` — shadcn popover component
- `src/components/ui/sheet.tsx` — shadcn sheet component (mobile nav)

## 2026-04-01 — Full MVP Implementation

### What Was Built
All 4 milestones implemented in a single session:

**Milestone 1 — Admin + Player Management**
- Supabase clients: browser, server (SSR with cookies), admin (service role)
- Middleware: admin route protection with session refresh and ADMIN_EMAIL check
- Login page with email/password auth
- Admin layout with sidebar navigation
- Admin dashboard with summary stats
- Player management: list, add, edit, delete, search, Elon status toggle per semester, player merge
- Semester management: list, add, edit dates, current/past/future badges

**Milestone 2 — Tournament Management**
- Manual tournament creation with player picker and placements
- start.gg import: URL → slug → event detection → standings preview → Elon flagging → confirm
- Set data stored silently from start.gg imports
- Tournament list with semester filter and delete
- Semester auto-assignment by tournament date

**Milestone 3 — Scoring Engine**
- `recalculateSemester()` in `/lib/scoring.ts` — exact formula from SPEC.md
- Pure helper functions: `computeWeight`, `computeScore`, `computeAverageScore`
- All admin actions (player Elon status, merge, tournament CRUD) trigger full recalc
- Scores stored in `player_semester_scores` table

**Milestone 4 — Public Leaderboard**
- Dark esports theme with top 3 podium (gold/silver/bronze)
- Semester selector dropdown
- Min tournaments slider (1-5, default 3)
- Rankings table sorted by averageScore ascending
- Public API endpoint: `/api/leaderboard`

## 2026-04-01 — Project Setup

### Decisions Made
- **Stack confirmed:** Next.js App Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Supabase + Vercel
- **Auth:** Single admin email via `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var, Supabase Auth, no registration
- **Scoring:** Exact weighted average placement formula from original system — not simplified
- **start.gg imports:** Placements only (no bracket data needed for scoring). Set data stored in `sets` table for future use.
- **Player merge:** Simple admin merge — select two players, combine into one, keep better placement on conflicts
- **Semesters:** Auto-generated Fall/Spring with editable date ranges
- **Database:** Supabase Postgres with RLS (public read, admin write via service role)

### Documents Created
- `SCORING_SYSTEM.md` — detailed analysis of the original scoring system
- `CLAUDE.md` — project instructions and constraints
- `SPEC.md` — full product requirements and milestones
- `docs/schema.sql` — complete database schema with RLS policies and seed data
- `docs/architecture.md` — system overview, request flows, file structure
- `docs/startgg-api.md` — start.gg GraphQL API reference (all queries, entity model, import flow, rate limits, pitfalls)
- `docs/changelog.md` — this file

### Table Names (from original plan → final)
| Plan Name | Final Table Name | Reason |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| semester_player_status | player_semester_status | Reads more naturally |
| tournament_participants | tournament_results | Clarifies it holds results, not just attendance |
| semester_scores | player_semester_scores | Clarifies these are per-player |
| (new) | sets | Stores bracket/match data from start.gg for future use |
