# Changelog

All notable changes to the Elon Esports Smash PR tracker.

---

## v1.1.0 — SEO & Social Sharing

### OpenGraph Preview Image
- **OG image** — `public/og-image.png` (hero screenshot) referenced in `openGraph.images` and `twitter.images` across root layout
- **Twitter card** upgraded from `summary` to `summary_large_image` for full-width preview when sharing links

### Canonical URLs
- `alternates.canonical` added to all 6 public pages: `/`, `/about`, `/faq`, `/players`, `/players/[playerId]`, and root layout default

### Structured Data
- **JSON-LD Organization schema** in root layout — club name, site URL, logo, description for Google knowledge panel

### Fixes
- **metadataBase** corrected from `elon-esports.vercel.app` to `elon-smash-pr.vercel.app` in layout, robots, and sitemap

---

## v1.0.0 — Release

### SEO & Crawling
- **robots.txt** (via `src/app/robots.ts`) — allows all public pages, disallows `/admin`, `/login`, `/api/`; links to sitemap
- **sitemap.xml** (via `src/app/sitemap.ts`) — static pages (home, players, about, FAQ) + dynamic player profile pages (queries Elon students from DB)
- **noindex on admin** — `robots: { index: false, follow: false }` on admin layout and login layout
- **Login page metadata** — "Admin Login" title via `login/layout.tsx`
- All public pages already had SEO metadata from v0.11.0 (home, players, about, FAQ, player profiles with dynamic `generateMetadata`)

### New Files
- `src/app/robots.ts` — Dynamic robots.txt generation
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` — Dynamic sitemap with player profiles
- `src/app/login/layout.tsx` — Login metadata (noindex, title)

---

## v0.12.0 — Shared Navigation, Security Headers, Login Redesign & UI Polish

### Shared Components
- **SiteHeader** — unified client component used on all public pages (home, players, about, FAQ); checks auth via `getUser()` and shows Login/Admin button; replaced 4 inline headers
- **SiteFooter** — shared footer with nav links, social icons (Discord, Twitch, Instagram, YouTube, X, TikTok), GitHub link, and disclaimer
- Player profile now uses SiteHeader with a breadcrumb (`Players > Tag`) below it

### Security
- **Security headers** in `next.config.ts`: X-Frame-Options (DENY), X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, HSTS (2yr + preload), Permissions-Policy, Content-Security-Policy (self + Supabase connect-src)
- **SiteHeader auth** switched from `getSession()` (local storage, spoofable) to `getUser()` (server-validated)
- Homepage no longer fetches auth server-side (removed `createClient` from page.tsx), improving cacheability

### Login Page Redesign
- Dark theme matching site aesthetic (`bg-[#030303]`)
- Shield icon + "Admin Sign In" header
- Info box: "This login is for tournament organizers only. Player accounts are not required to view rankings or profiles."
- Styled error state with red alert box
- Loading spinner on submit
- "Back to rankings" link, "Contact the current club captain for admin access" footer
- Fade-slide-up entrance animation

### About Page
- "Connect With Us" social section with 6 branded cards (Discord, Twitch, Instagram, YouTube, X, TikTok)
- Hover effects: icon scale + border/bg brighten

### FAQ Page
- Nav updated to match shared SiteHeader

### Player Profile
- **Tournament history** — show first 10 rows with "Show all X tournaments" expand button (matches h2h pattern)
- **Head-to-head sorting** — all columns clickable to sort (opponent, wins, losses, total, win rate); click toggles asc/desc; active column shows chevron direction
- **Semester cards** — replaced "Avg Score" (not meaningful) with "Top X% Percentile" computed from rank/total_ranked
- **Memoized h2h sort** — `useMemo` on sort + visible slice to avoid re-sorting on every render
- Consistent SiteHeader with breadcrumb navigation

### Navigation Consistency
- Removed redundant "Rankings" nav link (logo links home)
- Login/Admin button styled consistently (same `bg-white/[0.1]` treatment whether signed in or out)
- All public pages show: Players, About (desktop), FAQ (desktop), Login/Admin

### New Files
- `src/components/site-header.tsx` — Shared auth-aware navigation header
- `src/components/site-footer.tsx` — Shared footer with socials

---

## v0.11.0 — Branding, SEO, Pagination & Character Art

### Favicon & Branding
- Custom favicon set: `.ico`, `.svg`, `96x96 PNG`, Apple touch icon, PWA manifest icons
- SVG logo added to nav bars on leaderboard, players directory, admin sidebar, and admin mobile header
- PWA `site.webmanifest` with correct app name and dark theme color

### SEO

- Homepage: "Power Rankings" title + description
- Players directory: "Player Directory" title + description
- Player profile: dynamic `generateMetadata` with player's gamer tag

### Character Art in Hero
- 5 Smash Ultimate character renders (Mario, Captain Falcon, Kirby, Pikachu, Fox) inside floating geometric shapes
- Renders clipped inside shapes with 40% opacity + `mix-blend-luminosity` for frosted glass effect
- Downloaded from [smash-ultimate-assets](https://github.com/marcrd/smash-ultimate-assets), converted to optimized WebP (6MB PNG → 688KB WebP)
- `ElegantShape` component extended with optional `characterImg` and `imgClassName` props

### Players Directory
- Client-side pagination at 50 per page with prev/next controls
- Search resets to page 1
- Scatter plot still shows all filtered results

### UI Polish
- `LastUpdated` refresh button moved from bottom to above content on leaderboard and players pages
- "Not affiliated with Nintendo" disclaimer added to all public page footers

---

## v0.10.3 — Admin UI Redesign & Scrollbar Polish

### Import Tournament Dialog
- Standings preview moved from inline to a full-width dialog (`max-w-3xl`, 92vh)
- Rows are clickable to toggle Elon status (not just the switch)
- Elon-flagged rows get a subtle primary tint
- Search bar with icon, segmented filter buttons (All / Elon / Not Elon)
- Uppercase column headers, summary + confirm in dialog footer
- Confirm disabled when 0 Elon players selected

### Merge Players Dialog
- Expanded to `max-w-4xl` with side-by-side panels (Player A / Player B)
- Each panel has labeled header with colored badge (A = primary, B = destructive)
- Merge flow visualization appears when both players selected (Keep → merge into → Delete)
- Command lists scroll properly with `!max-h-[50vh]` override
- Merge button turns destructive when ready

### Players Page
- Toolbar consolidated into bordered bar with tab switcher + Elon Affiliation filter
- Smaller action buttons, tighter spacing

### Custom Scrollbars
- `styled-scroll` CSS class: 6px thin rounded thumb, subtle gray, darkens on hover
- Dark mode variant with lighter opacity
- Applied to: import dialog, merge dialog, manual entry picker, tournament results sheet/list

### Dashboard
- Recent tournament names link to start.gg when `startgg_slug` is available (opens in new tab)
- Manual tournaments remain plain text

---

## v0.10.2 — Semester Date Range Fix & Delete

### Auto-Create Semesters
- Removed Summer semester — only Spring and Fall now
- Spring: Jan 1 – Jul 31 (was Jan 15 – May 15, left Jan 1–14 in a gap)
- Fall: Aug 1 – Dec 31 (was Aug 16 – Dec 20, left Dec 21–31 in a gap)
- Every calendar date now maps to a semester with no gaps

### Semester Deletion
- `deleteSemester` server action — blocks if tournaments still reference the semester
- Cleans up `player_semester_scores` and `player_semester_status` rows before deleting
- Delete button added to admin semesters table with confirmation dialog

---

## v0.10.1 — Semester Tab Pagination

### Admin Players — Semester Tab
- Server-side pagination for the "By Semester" tab (was rendering all 500+ players from mixed locals at once)
- 50 players per page with Previous/Next controls and total count
- Debounced server-side search (300ms) — resets to page 1
- Elon filter applied server-side — resets to page 1
- `getPlayersWithStatus` now accepts `page`, `pageSize`, `search`, and `elonFilter` params

---

## v0.10.0 — SSR Optimization, Loading Skeletons & Hydration Fix

### Server-Side Rendering Migration
- **Admin Players** — split into server component (`page.tsx`) + client component (`players-client.tsx`); semesters, current semester, and initial player data fetched server-side in single `Promise.all`
- **Admin Tournaments** — split into server component + `tournaments-client.tsx`; semesters and initial tournaments fetched server-side
- **Admin Semesters** — split into server component + `semesters-client.tsx`; semesters fetched server-side
- Eliminates 5+ POST requests per admin page load (was one per `useEffect` call, doubled by React StrictMode in dev)

### Loading Skeletons
- **Route-level skeletons** (`loading.tsx`) for all 7 pages: admin dashboard, players, tournaments, semesters, public leaderboard, player directory, player profile
- Public page skeletons use dark theme (`bg-[#030303]`, `white/[0.06]` pulse) matching the cyberpunk aesthetic
- Leaderboard and players directory skeletons use empty spacers for the hero section (reserves exact height without visible placeholders, so framer-motion entrance animations play smoothly)
- **Inline table skeletons** for client-side loading states (semester switching, tab changes, pagination) — replaces plain "Loading..." text in all 3 admin client components

### Bug Fixes
- **Hydration mismatch in LastUpdated** — `formatTimeAgo()` called `Date.now()` during both server and client render, producing different relative timestamps ("20s ago" vs "21s ago"). Fixed by initializing state as empty string, computing only on client via `useEffect`.

### New Files
- `src/app/admin/loading.tsx` — Dashboard skeleton
- `src/app/admin/players/loading.tsx` — Players skeleton
- `src/app/admin/players/players-client.tsx` — Players interactive UI (extracted from page)
- `src/app/admin/semesters/loading.tsx` — Semesters skeleton
- `src/app/admin/semesters/semesters-client.tsx` — Semesters interactive UI (extracted from page)
- `src/app/admin/tournaments/loading.tsx` — Tournaments skeleton
- `src/app/admin/tournaments/tournaments-client.tsx` — Tournaments interactive UI (extracted from page)
- `src/app/loading.tsx` — Leaderboard skeleton
- `src/app/players/loading.tsx` — Player directory skeleton
- `src/app/players/[playerId]/loading.tsx` — Player profile skeleton

---

## v0.9.0 — Player Profile Visualizations & Import Fixes

### Player Profile Visualizations
- **Performance Signal** — waveform bar chart showing placement percentile per tournament, grouped by semester with color-coded tiers (gold 1st, orange podium, emerald top 25%, cyan top 50%, blue top 75%, red bottom)
- **Placement Timeline** — SVG line chart with smooth cubic spline showing percentile progression over time, field-size context bars along the bottom strip
- **Player Journey** — Spotify Wrapped-style vertical timeline of career milestones (first tournament, total events, set record, biggest rival, peak performance, podium streak, current standing)
- **Player Scatter** — scatter plot on players directory showing all Elon players by tournament count vs win rate
- Removed Avg Score stat card (not normalized across semesters)
- Removed Score Trend chart (replaced by Performance Signal + Placement Timeline)
- Profile header redesigned: atmospheric gradient background, HUD corner brackets, larger avatar with animated glow for top-3 ranks, stat cards with accent glow lines
- Player Journey contrast improvements: bumped label, detail, sub, and unit text opacity for readability
- Tournament history: names link to start.gg tournament page when `startgg_slug` is available

### Import Bug Fixes
- **Elon status carry-forward** — when importing the first tournament of a new semester, Elon flags are now carried forward from the most recent previous semester (was showing all players as non-Elon, causing 0 scores)
- **Elon status toggle on import** — unchecking a previously-Elon player during import now upserts `is_elon_student: false` (was silently preserving the old `true` status)

### Other Fixes
- Fixed SVG `<title>` hydration mismatch in PlacementTimeline (array children → template string)
- Added `startgg_slug` to player profile tournament results query
- Added `scripts/` to tsconfig exclude (test files had duplicate declarations)

### New Files
- `src/app/players/[playerId]/performance-signal.tsx` — Waveform bar chart
- `src/app/players/[playerId]/placement-timeline.tsx` — Percentile progression chart
- `src/app/players/[playerId]/player-journey.tsx` — Career milestone timeline
- `src/app/players/player-scatter.tsx` — Directory scatter plot

### Dead Code
- `src/app/players/[playerId]/matchup-chart.tsx` — radial matchup chart (created but replaced by PlayerJourney, not imported anywhere)

---

## v0.8.0 — Admin Onboarding Guide

### Admin Dashboard
- "First time here?" collapsible card on the admin dashboard
- FAQ-style accordion: Import a Tournament, Manage Players, View Tournaments, Public Rankings
- Each step expands with structured intro, scannable bullet points (left-border accent), optional tips, and pill CTA links
- Active step highlights with filled icon and primary border tint
- Collapsed steps show preview intro text below the title
- Collapsed by default, click anywhere on the header to expand

### New Files
- `src/app/admin/getting-started.tsx` — Onboarding guide component

---

## v0.7.0 — Performance Optimizations

### Rendering & Bundle
- framer-motion: switched to `LazyMotion` + `domAnimation` (~5KB vs ~32KB gzipped)
- Fireworks: animation loop stops when particles are gone (was running `requestAnimationFrame` forever)
- Fireworks: swap-and-pop particle removal instead of O(n) `splice` in hot loop
- `fadeUpVariants` hoisted to module scope (no re-allocation per render)

### Data Fetching
- Leaderboard: fetch directly from change handlers, removed `useEffect`/`useCallback` chain (eliminates double-render)
- Min tournaments slider: 300ms debounce (was firing API request per drag tick)
- Players page: queries filtered by Elon player IDs (was fetching entire `tournament_results` and `sets` tables)
- Profile: `totalSets`, `totalWins`, `winPct`, and reversed arrays computed server-side (no client recomputation)

### Caching Bug Fixes
- API route (`/api/leaderboard`): switched from HTTP `s-maxage` to `unstable_cache` with `leaderboard-data` tag so `updateTag` invalidates both SSR and client-side requests
- `recalculateSemester`: retries once after 3s when lock is held, busts cache tags on fallback (prevents stale data when new tournament data races with concurrent recalc)
- Scoring step 8: upsert and select now sequential (was parallel race condition for stale detection)

### Cache Refresh UX
- "Updated Xs ago" + refresh button in main content area (visible in empty states and below tables)
- Server-enforced 15s cooldown per IP+tag on cache refresh
- Client shows countdown timer when rate limited

### New Files
- `src/lib/supabase/static.ts` — Cookie-free Supabase client for use inside `unstable_cache`
- `src/components/last-updated.tsx` — Refresh button with cooldown timer
- `src/lib/actions/refresh-cache.ts` — Server action with rate limiting

---

## v0.5.0 — Player Deletion Removal & Scoring Fixes

### Breaking Changes
- Player deletion removed entirely — merge is the only way to consolidate players
- Delete buttons, batch delete UI, and all `deletePlayer`/`deletePlayers` functions removed

### Scoring Fixes
- Merge no longer decrements `total_participants` — merged players are the same person tracked twice
- Weight formula documented correctly: `weight = elon_participants / total_participants` (no normalization)

---

## v0.4.0 — Player Profiles, Public Pages Redesign & Optimization

### Player Profile Pages (`/players/[id]`)
- Hero avatar with gradient backgrounds and glow for top-3 ranked players
- Stat cards: Current Rank, Best Placement, Avg Score, Set Record (colored icons)
- SVG trend chart with monotone cubic spline interpolation and glow filter
- Head-to-head records table with win-rate bars, sorted by total sets, expandable beyond 10
- Tournament history with placement badges (gold/silver/bronze) and staggered animations
- Breadcrumb nav: Rankings / Players / GamerTag
- Server action fetches all data in 3 parallel batches (player+status -> scores+results+sets -> ranks+opponents)

### Players Directory (`/players`)
- All Elon players across all semesters (not current-only, since h2h spans semesters)
- Stats bar: player count, total sets, champions count (memoized)
- Search with `useMemo` filtering by gamer tag
- Mobile: card grid with avatars and set records; Desktop: sortable table
- `PlayerAvatar` with ring colors for top-3 placements

### Public Pages Redesign
- HeroGeometric animated component (framer-motion floating shapes with `motion.div`)
- Leaderboard hero: "Power / Rankings" with gradient text and floating geometric shapes
- Players hero: "Player / Directory" with Elon subtitle
- Dark theme overhaul: `bg-[#030303]` with `white/[opacity]` system across all public pages
- Sticky header with `backdrop-blur-lg`, "Players" nav link added
- Controls bar separated from hero, content area has `rounded-t-3xl bg-white/[0.02]` elevation
- Mobile-responsive controls: full-width on mobile, fixed-width on desktop

### Optimization
- Removed dead `tournamentCount` variable and unused `average_score` from `PlayerListItem`
- Merged two loops over tournament results into single pass (best placement + count)
- Memoized `totalSets` and `championsCount` in players list client
- Removed unused `loser_score`/`winner_score` columns from sets queries in player profile
- Parallelized rank computation + opponent tag fetch (was 2 sequential calls, now 1 parallel batch)
- Player profile: 4 sequential DB batches -> 3

### New Files
- `src/app/players/page.tsx` — Players directory (Server Component)
- `src/app/players/players-list-client.tsx` — Interactive players list UI
- `src/app/players/[playerId]/page.tsx` — Player profile (Server Component)
- `src/app/players/[playerId]/profile-client.tsx` — Interactive profile UI
- `src/lib/actions/player-profile.ts` — Player profile server action
- `src/components/ui/shape-landing-hero.tsx` — Animated geometric hero (framer-motion)

### Dependencies
- Added `framer-motion` for animated hero components

---

## v0.3.0 — Idempotency, Optimization & UX Polish

### Idempotency Guards
- `createTournament` — rejects duplicate name + date + semester (prevents manual double-submit)
- `createPlayer` — rejects duplicate gamer tags (case-insensitive)
- `createSemester` — rejects duplicate names (case-insensitive, checked in parallel with overlap validation)
- `confirmTournamentImport` — already had `startgg_event_id` deduplication (no change needed)

### React Optimization
- Fixed drag handler closures in manual tournament creator defeating `React.memo` — callbacks now stable via `useCallback` with index passed as prop
- Memoized merge dialog filter results (`filteredKeepPlayers`, `filteredMergePlayers`) with `useMemo` instead of inline `.filter().slice()` on every keystroke
- Cached merge dialog player data — `allPlayersLoaded` flag prevents refetching on every dialog open; invalidated after successful merge

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed merge dialog state not resetting on close (mergeKeepId, mergeMergeId, keepSearch, mergeSearch)
- Fixed scoring engine `existingResult` not error-checked in step 8
- Fixed scoring engine lock release error not caught in finally block
- Fixed missing error checks on `updateSemester` parallel fetches (tournamentsRes, allSemestersRes, orphanedRes)
- Fixed missing `keepStatusesRes` error check in `mergePlayers`
- Fixed missing error check on `checkSemesterOverlap` query result
- Fixed dialog state resets for add, edit, and IDs dialogs on close

### Error Pages
- Added `not-found.tsx` (404) with "Back to Leaderboard" link
- Added `error.tsx` (500) with "Try Again" button and console error logging
- Added `global-error.tsx` for errors that escape root layout (includes own `<html>/<body>`)

### Concurrency Safety
- Recalculate button disabled + tooltip when semester has no tournaments (both dashboard dialog and tournaments page)
- Server-side guard: `recalculateSemesterScores` returns early with error message if no tournaments exist
- Per-semester tournament counts passed to dashboard recalculate dialog

### Performance — Leaderboard SSR
- Converted home page from full client-side to Server Component with parallel data fetching
- Semesters, auth state, and initial leaderboard data fetched in one server round trip (zero client waterfalls)
- Interactive UI (semester picker, min tournaments, fireworks) extracted to `leaderboard-client.tsx`
- Eliminated dynamic `import()` of server actions from client bundle
- Replaced Base UI Slider with native `<input type="range">` to fix React script tag error

### UX Polish
- "Admin" button on leaderboard styled as solid primary pill when signed in (subtle "Login" text when signed out)
- "Load Standings" button on start.gg import: flush height with event dropdown, stacks below on mobile
- Recalculate buttons show "No tournaments in this semester" tooltip/message when grayed out

### New Files
- `src/app/not-found.tsx` — 404 page
- `src/app/error.tsx` — Runtime error boundary
- `src/app/global-error.tsx` — Root error boundary
- `src/app/leaderboard-client.tsx` — Interactive leaderboard UI (extracted from page.tsx)

---

## v0.2.0 — Leaderboard Redesign, Auto-Semesters & Query Optimization

### Leaderboard Redesign
- Animated podium with Lucide `Trophy` (1st) and `Medal` (2nd/3rd) icons, gradient glows, and drop shadows
- Canvas-based fireworks particle system — 8 staggered bursts with gravity, fade, and glow trails
- Podium cards bounce in with `cubic-bezier` spring animation, medals pop in with rotate/scale
- Staggered row fade-in animation for the rankings table
- Gradient text on "Power Rankings" heading
- Tournament count displayed on each podium card
- Consistent Lucide icons in both podium and table (replacing OS-dependent emoji)

### Auto-Create Semesters
- `findOrCreateSemester(date, client)` — shared helper used by both manual entry and start.gg import
- Academic calendar conventions: Spring (Jan 1 – Jul 31), Fall (Aug 1 – Dec 31)
- Trims auto-generated range to avoid overlapping existing semesters
- Duplicate name detection with date-range suffix fallback
- Added overlap validation to both `createSemester()` and `updateSemester()`

### Query Optimization
- Eliminated N+1 queries in `updateSemester` — fetches all semesters once + parallelizes all tournament move operations
- Removed redundant client creation — `determineSemester()` replaced with direct queries on existing admin client
- Removed dead `determineSemester()` function
- Reused batch-fetched data in `deletePlayer` — added `total_participants` to initial tournament query
- Leaderboard fallback — collapsed two sequential semester queries into one sorted query with client-side pick
- Minimal column fetches — semester lookups use `select('id')` instead of `select('*')` in 3 places
- `.maybeSingle()` over `.single()` — avoids PGRST116 error handling

### Dead Code Removal
- Removed unused `PlayerSemesterScore` and `GameSet` interfaces from `types.ts`
- Removed unused `Semester` import from `tournaments.ts`

---

## v0.1.1 — Performance, Validation & Security Audit

### Performance Optimizations

**Scoring Engine (`src/lib/scoring.ts`) — Complete Rewrite**
- Parallel batch operations: all tournament results fetched in parallel (one query per tournament to avoid Supabase's 1000-row default limit)
- Batched score updates: results with same score value updated in single `WHERE id IN (...)` query
- Stale score cleanup: deletes leftover scores for players no longer marked Elon
- NaN/Infinity guards on `computeWeight` and `computeScore`

**start.gg Import (`src/lib/actions/tournaments.ts`)**
- Deferred sets import with `after()` from `next/server` — response returns in ~2-3s instead of 15-30s
- Parallel semester lookup + duplicate check in `confirmTournamentImport`
- Parallel players + semester fetch in `buildImportPreview`

**start.gg Client (`src/lib/startgg.ts`)**
- Standings perPage: 64 -> 100 (fewer pages, stays under 1000-object complexity cap)
- Sets perPage: 28 -> 40
- Inter-page delay: 750ms -> 400ms

**Admin Dashboard (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`)**
- Replaced full row fetches with count-only queries (`{ count: 'exact', head: true }`)
- 4 stat cards, recent tournaments list, quick actions
- Uses inline Tailwind classes instead of `buttonVariants()` (server component compatibility)

**Players Page (`src/app/admin/players/page.tsx`)**
- Parallel semester loading with `Promise.all`
- Optimistic Elon status toggle with revert-on-error
- Fixed 1000-row limit bug with paginated tournament_results query

**Tournaments Page (`src/app/admin/tournaments/new/page.tsx`)**
- Lazy player loading: only fetches when Manual Entry tab is activated

**Player Actions (`src/lib/actions/players.ts`)**
- `mergePlayers`: 6 queries consolidated to 1 parallel round, self-merge prevention
- `getPlayersWithStatus`: paginated to handle >1000 tournament results

**Semester Actions (`src/lib/actions/semesters.ts`)**
- Parallel recalculations in `updateSemester`

### Data Validation
- All server actions trim and validate inputs (empty gamer tags, empty semester names)
- Tournament creation validates: name required, date format YYYY-MM-DD, >=1 participant, finite totalParticipants
- Semester date validation: start must be before end (server + client)
- start.gg import filters out standings with invalid placements
- Empty gamer tags from start.gg fall back to "Unknown"
- Scoring engine guards: `computeWeight` and `computeScore` return 0 for NaN/Infinity/negative inputs

### Security
- Case-insensitive email comparison at all 3 auth checkpoints (proxy, layout, `requireAdmin()`)
- Migrated `src/middleware.ts` -> `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 convention)
- Confirmed: RLS policies restrict public to read-only, all mutations use service role
- Supabase config: email signups disabled, rate limits configured

### New Files
- `src/app/admin/recalculate-button.tsx` — Client component for manual score recalculation
- `src/proxy.ts` — Replaces `src/middleware.ts` for Next.js 16
- `src/components/ui/popover.tsx` — shadcn popover component
- `src/components/ui/sheet.tsx` — shadcn sheet component (mobile nav)

---

## v0.1.0 — Full MVP Implementation

### What Was Built
All 4 milestones implemented:

**Milestone 1 — Admin + Player Management**

- Middleware: admin route protection with session refresh and ADMIN_EMAIL check
- Login page with email/password auth
- Admin layout with sidebar navigation
- Admin dashboard with summary stats
- Player management: list, add, edit, search, Elon status toggle per semester, player merge
- Semester management: list, add, edit dates, current/past/future badges

**Milestone 2 — Tournament Management**

## v0.0.1 — Project Setup

### Decisions Made
- **Stack:** Next.js App Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Supabase + Vercel
- **Auth:** Single admin email via `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var, Supabase Auth, no registration
- **Scoring:** Exact weighted average placement formula from original system
- **start.gg imports:** Placements only (no bracket data needed for scoring). Set data stored in `sets` table for future use.
- **Player merge:** Select two players, combine into one, keep better placement on conflicts
- **Semesters:** Auto-generated Fall/Spring with editable date ranges
- **Database:** Supabase Postgres with RLS (public read, admin write via service role)

### Documents Created
- `SCORING_SYSTEM.md` — detailed analysis of the original scoring system
- `SPEC.md` — full product requirements and milestones
- `docs/schema.sql` — complete database schema with RLS policies and seed data
- `docs/architecture.md` — system overview, request flows, file structure
- `docs/startgg-api.md` — start.gg GraphQL API reference
- `docs/changelog.md` — this file

### Table Names (from original plan -> final)
